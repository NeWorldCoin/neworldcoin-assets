### üìå Reason for Logo Request Approval

Visibility is trust. When users can see the official logo of a token in Trust Wallet, they immediately associate it with credibility, legitimacy, and security. On the contrary, when a logo is missing, it creates **doubt, hesitation, and weakens adoption**.

We respectfully emphasize that **this is not just about aesthetics**, but about **building psychological confidence** and empowering safe user interaction. This logo represents a project that has:

- ‚úÖ A fixed supply and immutable smart contract
- ‚úÖ A public roadmap, open liquidity, and full transparency
- ‚úÖ No hidden backdoors or minting functions
- ‚úÖ Official support and documentation across channels

We appreciate your time, work, and consideration.
